# INDY-LEARNS-QB
Question Bank for the INDY LEARNS rating courses. Anyone may add questions that will be entered into the question banks after I reivew them.

## Aiken format
* Each question 'block' should contain no blank lines within, but should be seperated from the adjacent ones with blank lines.
* Questions should be complete sentences when posible. Include 3-5 options in multiple choice. 2 options may be used for True/False statments.
* Option lines must begin with a capitol letter, A-E, in order. That should be followed by a period and a tab.
* The key is denoted by the string `ANSWER: X` with 'x' being the capitol letter of the correct answer.
* Currently this system is limited to text only questions, no images files or links should be used as part of a question.
